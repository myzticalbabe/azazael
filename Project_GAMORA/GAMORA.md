# PROJECT GAMORA -- Gamora DOMellifluousML cliT

One command over parts that existed and did not know about each other.

| part | where it lives | what Gamora does with it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lilith swarm / Spitfire** | `scripts/lilith_live_monitor.py`, `src/spitfire/`, `src/eve_unleashed/swarm_oracle.py` | `gamora lilith` reads hive status; `gamora swarm` fans claims natively |
| **Eve Unleashed** | `src/eve_unleashed/cli.py` | `gamora eve -- <args>` passes through; Eve runs |
| **Jaeger 3:16T** | `src/AOA/core/delegation_tracer.py` + `src/CORE/cd3_exporter.py` | every injection writes one span; `gamora inject` wraps any prompt |
| **Cradle** | `Project_CRADLE/cradle.py` | `gamora cradle -- <args>` passes through |
| **Lucy** | `Project_LUCY/lucy.py` | `gamora lucy <mood> [note]` -- Eliza + therapy, offline-first |

## Why a harness and not a merge

The parts keep their paths because gates, docs, and the graph quote
those paths. Gamora is the front door: one file to run, one doctor to
trust, and the machinery where the gates already point. It adds no
judgement of its own -- only routing plus one Jaeger span per
delegation, so "was this the right choice" stays answerable from the
ledger.

## Commands

    python gamora.py doctor
    python gamora.py lilith [--once]
    python gamora.py eve -- <eve args>
    python gamora.py cradle -- <cradle args>
    python gamora.py lucy <mood> [note] [--json]
    python gamora.py swarm <claim> [...]
    python gamora.py inject "prompt" [--capability C --arm A]

Requires the 316t free-threaded interpreter
(`C:/Azazael/.venvs/py316t/Scripts/python.exe`). `doctor` exits 1
without it.

## OpenCode evolution: Jaeger 3:16T prompt injectors

`jaeger_inject.py` is the OpenCode CLI evolved: same prompt in, plus a
`<jaeger-316t trace_id=... span_id=...>` header, the max push/drive
directive block, and one span in the tree's own ledger. The span write
never fails the prompt (header-only degradation).

Wire into OpenCode with one hook:

    { "hooks": { "pre-prompt": "python C:/Azazael/azazael/Project_GAMORA/opencode_jaeger_hook.py" } }

Or call `gamora inject` / `jaeger_inject.py` by hand.
